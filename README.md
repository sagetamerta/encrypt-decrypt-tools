# Encryption and Decryption Tool for URL Parameters

This repository provides a set of tools for encrypting and decrypting text that will be used as parameters in a URL. It ensures that you have an encryption key to generate the desired text format.

## Overview

The purpose of this repository is to enable secure transmission of sensitive information through URLs. It offers a convenient way to encrypt plain text into a format suitable for embedding in a URL and decrypting it back to its original form.

## Features

- Encryption: Convert plain text into an encrypted format suitable for URL parameters.
- Decryption: Reverse the encryption process and retrieve the original text from an encrypted URL parameter.
- Encryption Key: Ensure the availability of an encryption key for generating the desired text format.
- Security: Implement secure encryption algorithms to protect sensitive information during transmission.
